# Box Brand Style Guide — FY26  ## Introduction

Everything we do at Box ladders up to one goal: Blow our customers’ minds. No company has more compelling tools or better capabilities to power business today. As we move forward with this goal in mind, it’s more important than ever to have one voice and visual language to amplify our message. From a simple one-pager to in-depth videos or presentations, staying on brand helps Box — and our team — reach our full epic potential.

Being intentional and consistent with how we design every customer interaction will increase our brand’s impact, better serve our customers, and allow us to continue to stand out as a company on a mission.

This document will serve as an ongoing reference to produce Box experiences that blow our customers’ minds. Please reach out to the Brand team via Michelle Skinner (michelleskinner@box.com) if you have any questions or need help making our brand the best it can be.

## Brand Verbal Identity

### Be a Box Storyteller

Do you write about Box? That makes you a writer! Get to know our brand story, and put it to work to engage prospects and clients.

**Our story: The leading Intelligent Content Management platform**

Box is the Intelligent Content Management leader. We provide a secure, easy-to-use platform that enables organizations to fuel collaboration, secure critical content, and transform business workflows with enterprise AI. We help businesses get more from their most valuable assets.

From clinical trial data, to blueprints and blockbuster movie scripts, content powers every business. And no one knows content like Box.

### Our Writing Style

Consistent branding makes the value of Box clear, so we need to share our story in a way that’s succinct and conversational.

- **Make it human**  
Write the same way you’d speak to a coworker. Aim for a professional, conversational tone. Use strong verbs, and engage your reader with the second-person “you.”

- **Simplicity over everything**  
Just like our brand story, our writing style isn’t fussy. We keep our sentence structure simple and don’t use many exclamation points, ellipses, or parentheses. Plus, we try to keep our writing short and sweet and avoid laundry lists of items.

- **Sentence case, not title case**  
Sentence case helps us keep things fresh and casual. We capitalize just the first letter, which means we *Write like this* and *Not Like This*. That goes for webinars, breakout sessions, and slide titles too.

- **Our stance on jargon**  
Sometimes you can’t avoid buzzwords. Maybe you need to talk about digital transformation or hardened infrastructure. Where possible, though, use stripped-down ways to explain complex concepts.

### Voice and Tone

Our brand voice is defined as the reliable and unchanging characteristics of Box. In essence, a brand voice is a brand’s character. It’s the guardrails that keeps our storytelling consistent — and it needs to underline all our messaging.

**Box voice attributes:**  
- Empathetic  
  We see the world through our customers’ eyes — and base our solutions on a deep understanding of their needs.  
- Open  
  We keep things optimistic and transparent. We’re self-aware, but not too serious.  
- Direct  
  We speak with conviction and expertise, but we’re still friendly and conversational. We say what we mean, and we mean what we say.  
- Universal  
  We maintain a spirit of inclusivity and accessibility.

**Tone**  
Voice is who we are. When it comes to tone, now you’re talking about how you express those values based on a given readership, campaign, or objective. So, where brand voice represents our character, tone is kind of like a mood. For example, one webinar might target executives and call for a visionary/thought leadership tone, while another targets IT with candid rhetoric and dry humor. While we use a wide range of tones, our underlying voice (or character) remains constant.

**Focus on relevance**  
You might be surprised to learn that telling our story has little to do with, well, us! We need to make our story matter to prospects. As you write, ask yourself: Why does my audience care about Box (or whichever product I’m selling)? What’s it help them do?

## Brand Visual Identity

### Visual Character Attributes

Our brand voice, the unchanging characteristics of Box, also apply here as visual character attributes. These characteristics are the baseline checklist for any piece of content we design.

At a glance, a piece of content from Box should come across as empathetic, open, direct, and universal. Now these are guardrails, not scientific measures, and are intentionally broad to allow personalization.

This is where tone — or style if we are talking about visual communication — comes in, which is adapted to specific audiences. The style of the content we design should fit the intended audience and support the story we want to tell. The choice of image, the color used, the way these are combined with messages in the layout, are ways to adapt the style of your story to fit your audience.

### Logos

Our primary branding element is the Box logo. It symbolizes the Box experience, lives throughout our products, and represents Box in marketing efforts.

- **Logo color**  
Use the Box Blue color for the Box logo in instances where the background color is light. Use the white version of the Box logo in instances where the background color is dark.

- **Exceptional use cases**  
Where space is constrained and the logo shows up above a headline over a background color, such as ads and social posts, the logo should be white at 65% opacity, to allow headlines to stand out.

- **Legibility**  
Minimum clear space around the logo is determined by the “o” character from the logo. Minimum size: never smaller than 50px width on screen or 1/4 inch in print. Always vertically center the logo based on the “o”.

- **Programs and products lockups**  
Box adopts a simple convention to lock up our logo with official product or program names. Different rules apply depending on whether the name is 12 characters or less, or longer.

- **Misuse to avoid:**  
  - Using colors other than Box Blue or White  
  - Using outdated versions of the logo such as the cloud lockup  
  - Adding visual effects like drop shadows  
  - Distorting, rotating, changing fill or outline  
  - Using the logo in phrases or sentences  
  - Using the logo over textures or images that compromise legibility

- **Partner or customer logo lockups**  
When juxtaposing logos, respect each logo’s clear space rules and aim for even visual balance.

### Typography

We use a new, open source typeface named **Inter**, designed specifically for screens, with two styles: Inter and Inter Display.

- **Inter Display** is best for headlines and subheads.  
- **Inter** is reserved for body copy.

**Type hierarchy:**  
- Super headlines: Inter Display Extra Light, line spacing 110% font size min.  
- Large headlines: Inter Display Medium, ~4/5 size of super headlines, line spacing 115%.  
- Headlines: Inter Display SemiBold, <3/4 size of large headlines, line spacing 120%.  
- Subheads: Inter Display SemiBold or Regular, <2/3 size of headlines, line spacing 125%.  
- Body copy subheads: Inter SemiBold or Regular.  
- Body copy: Inter Regular, ~1/2 size of subhead, line spacing 150%.

**Exceptions:**  
Some applications require special considerations, e.g., corporate PowerPoint templates use Arial as system typeface. When Inter or Inter Display aren’t available (email, PPT shared outside Box), fallback to Arial Bold or Regular.

### Imagery

- **Cloud and icon patterns:** Ambient patterns add visual interest to gradient backgrounds, evoking cloud-based technology. Used on solution pages, ads, banners, presentations.

- **Industry images:** Combine photography, icons, UI elements, and messages to communicate how content managed on Box becomes more valuable across industries. Engage Brand team before creating new images.

- **Devices and screenshots:** Generic mobile devices and browser graphics show products in context. Mobile device and background color should match. Choose clean, relevant screenshots with Brand/product marketing input.

- **Illustrations:** Describe interactions between people and content on Box. Combine stylized product screenshots, action labels, photography, UI elements, and custom iconography. Contact Brand team for custom illustrations.

- **Photography:** Depicts customers and their stories. Two types: contextual (reflecting customer business and environment) and detail (tools and creations). Should be beautiful, dynamic, culturally diverse, inspiring, and distinctive.

- **Photography guidelines:** Only use properly licensed images. Avoid contrived stock photos, placing text over busy areas, cropping faces, cluttered or low-res images, and blatantly AI-generated images.

- **Icons and cards:** Communicate ideas in product and marketing. Cards represent content types inside Box. Avoid modifying stroke weights/fills, mixing scales, adding/removing elements, using line art versions, or changing colors.
